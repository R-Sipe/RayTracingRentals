## Resources

[StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was a great resource

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp) was a great resource to use for MVC and ASP.NET frameworks

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) was used for the styling and layout

[Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/) is more complex reading for overall structure of MVC Etc.
